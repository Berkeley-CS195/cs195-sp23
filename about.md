**Enrollment**: If you are looking to enroll in this course but do not meet
EECS department enrollment categories, please make a private post on Ed.

CS 195 is a discussion-intensive course about the social implications of
computer technology. The purpose of this course is to help students make
informed and thoughtful choices about their careers, participation in society,
and future development activities. Readings and lecture topics are drawn from a
range of fields that together seek to describe our contemporary global society:
sociology, philosophy, economics, public policy, etc.

## CS H195

CS H195 is a 3-unit class with the following expectations:

* In addition to CS 195 lecture, you'll go to 60-90 minute in-person discussion sections led by a GSI, once weekly.
* You will actively discuss each CS 195 topic in more depth.
* You will work on interesting projects / papers that replace the usual CS 195 essays.

## Weekly Schedule

Lecture: Tuesday 3:30 to 5:00 PM

Lecture will be hybrid in the Physics Building 1 (Physics 1) with a Zoom simulcast.
Participation will be expected for both in-person and Zoom students. We'll make
it work. There will *not* be after-the-fact recordings posted.

Readings for each week will be released one week before each next class (or thereabouts).

**Please finish the readings before class!**

Lecture topics will not be determined only by the wisdom of your instructor.
Instead, you will collectively choose your own adventure through the material.  To guide discussion topics, a weekly survey will be announced on Ed.

**Please submit the weekly survey each week by Monday 11:59 pm Pacific!**

## Lecture and Attendance

Lecture is going to be a mix of presentations, students asking questions, small
group discussion, and class-wide debriefing.

Attendance will be taken in class and is required [either online or in-person].
You cannot have a time conflict. The lecture is the vast majority of the
experience of the class.

If interested, please fill out the interest form listed on the
[Course Catalog](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-spring-compsci-h195-001-lec-001).
**Course applications for H195 are due Wednesday 1/25 11:59pm PT.**

## Essays

You will write two short essays (500-1000 words) of varying format in relation
to issues discussed in class. Essays are peer reviewed, which means you will
review six essays and have each of your essays reviewed by three of your peers.

## Ethics in the News

You will complete an Ethics in the News assignment. Details to be released.

## Grading

The course is graded P/NP. The reason for that policy is to ensure that you can
feel free to express opinions that are different from those of the instructors,
both in class meetings and in written work.

In order to receive a passing grade in CS 195, you must:

* Attend at least 10 (out of 13) lectures (excludes the first lecture).
* Complete at least 10 (out of 14) pre-lecture surveys.
* Submit 2 essays and receive a passing peer review grade on all of them.
* Provide peer reviews for 6 essays.
* Complete the Ethics in the News assignment.


## Accommodations

We understand that situations come up during the semester.

**Lecture attendance**: Please use your built-in absences first before
contacting staff about additional makeups. You may make up lecture attendance
by attending the H195 discussion section (discussion meeting times in sidebar).
Note that sections often require prework, so please do make a private post on
Ed in advance so we can provide you with details.

**Pre-lecture surveys**: Please use your built-in survey drops first before
contacting staff about additional makeups. These will be reopened for
completion as needed. Please make a private post on Ed.

**Essays**: *As of now there are no plans to offer makeup essays.* While we do
not want this 1-unit seminar to stress you out, please also understand that
because of our grading timelines, essays must be submitted by the posted
deadline. If you have extenuating circumstances or anticipate an overlap with
your commitments (personal emergencies, exams, etc.), please make a private Ed
post as soon as possible so we can provide a short extension or another
accommodation. We will review each extension request on an individual basis.

**DSP**: If you have a DSP-approved accommodation, please create a private post
on the Ed forum so we can allocate extensions based on your letter on record.
<!--describing your accommodation or the extenuating circumstances, as well as
the number of additional days that you require to complete the assignment.
